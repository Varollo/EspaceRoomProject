### Crow Puzzle
- Move to the right again and click on the cage with the crow to start a quizz about math, the answers to the questions are as follows:
	- "Let's do it!"
	- "Division"
	- "2^(1/2)"
	- "a^2 = b^2+c^2"
	- "Take it!"

- After finishing the game you'll get the **Crow Feather** item.

### Potion Puzzle
- After getting all three itens, move once again to the right and click on the cauldrom to start the last puzzle game.
- You will need to get all 3 bars to be the same level.
- To increase the level of a bar, click the button bellow it, but beware, they also affect the other bars in this way:
	- +red = -blue
	- +green = -red -blue
	- +blue = -green
> An easy way to solve this puzzle is to get the green bar to the top, the blue bar to the botton and the red bar to the middle, then, clicking the blue button until they are all the same value:
